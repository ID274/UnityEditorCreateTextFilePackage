Hello, World!

This file was created using the TextFileCreator and will outline how to use it. 

1. Open the window by going to Window > TextFileCreator

2. Click the button to choose your path. Be reasonable as there aren't any safeguards outside of what may be built into Unity. 

3. Click the "Create Text File" button. Some fields will pop up. Fill in the file name, the file contents (allows multiple lines, just make sure to press enter).

4. Choose how your file should be managed. By ticking the overwrite tickbox, it means that if a file by the same name would be found in the folder, it will be completely overriden. 
If it is unchecked, it will create a new one with a number at the end, indicating how many files of the same name were found. The limit is 100 at the time of writing this. 

5. The append tickbox means that if a file was found by the same name, your file contents will instead be added on the next line instead of replacing the contents entirely. 

6. When finished, simply press the confirm button and refresh your targeted folder - it should now contain your newly created file!
